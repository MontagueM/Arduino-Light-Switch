# Arduino Light Switch Listener

light_switch_assistant_listener.py is the main program. Listens for a file created 'a.txt' that can be created by anything (e.g. pushbullet from phone).
Would be better with a web-socket but can't be bothered.

light_switch.py is a testing program to ensure that the servo is connected and working correctly and to find the working angles.
