# Arduino Light Switch Listener

light_switch_assistant_listener.py is the main program. Listens for a file created 'listener/a.txt' that can be created by anything (e.g. pushbullet from phone).
Would be better with a web-socket.

light_switch_test.py is a testing program to ensure that the servo is connected and working correctly and to find the working angles for the light switch.
